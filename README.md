# Basic HTML Website

This is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to build a simple multi-page website using only HTML. The goal is to understand how to **structure a website semantically** before adding any styles or interactivity.

## 📚 Project Goals

- Understand the semantic structure of a website.
- Learn how to create and link multiple HTML pages.
- Use common HTML tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<form>`.
- Include basic SEO meta tags in the `<head>` of each page.
- Prepare a clean structure for future CSS styling.

## 📁 Pages Included

| Page         | Description                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `index.html` | Homepage with a basic introduction.          |
| `projects.html` | Lists sample projects.                    |
| `articles.html` | Contains a few sample article entries.    |

Each HTML page includes basic SEO meta tags:
- `description`
- `keywords`
